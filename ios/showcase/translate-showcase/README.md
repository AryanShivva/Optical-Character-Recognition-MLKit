# ML Kit Translate Demo with Material Design

This app demonstrates how to build an end-to-end user experience with [Google ML Kit APIs](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit) and following the new [Material for ML design guidelines](https://material.io/design/machine-learning/).

The goal is to make it as easy as possible to integrate ML Kit into your app with an experience that has been user tested:

* Real-time translate using the on-device Text Recognition, Language ID, Translate APIs - an end-to-end solution from text recognition to translate in live camera.

## Steps to run the app

1. Clone this repo locally
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/googlecodelabs/mlkit-ios
  ```
2. Find a `Podfile` in the folder and install all the dependency pods by running the following command:
  ```
  cd mlkit-ios
  cd translate
  pod cache clean --all
  pod install --repo-update
  ```
3. Open the generated `TranslateDemo.xcworkspace` file.
4. [Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup),if you don't already have one.
5. Add a new iOS app into your Firebase project with a bundle ID like ***com.google.firebase.ml.md***.
6. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` from the newly added app and add it to the
  ShowcaseApp project in Xcode. Remember to check `Copy items if needed` and
  select `Create folder references`.
7. Select the project in Xcode and uncheck `Automatically manage signing` option in
  `General` tab, and choose your own provisioning file.
8. Build and run it on a physical device (the simulator isn't recommended, as the app needs to use the camera on the device).

## How to use the app

This app demonstrates live text translate using the camera:
* Open the app and point the bounding box of the camera at a text of interest. The recognized text and it's detected language will show up on the top part of the bottom sheet.
* As you keep the camera stable to recognize a text, you'll see the translated version of this text on the bottom in real-time using the on-device Translate API.
* You can also switch the translate language using the chips below, or clicking the "More" chip to search & select any of the 59 languages available.
